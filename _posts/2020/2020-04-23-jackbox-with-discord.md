[jackbox.tv](https://www.jackboxgames.com/) is collection of quirky, gameshow
style, party games. Originally it was intended to be played locally, but thanks
to "technology" it's possible to play the game with players all over the place.

## What is jackbox.tv?

[jackbox.tv](https://www.jackboxgames.com/) is a series of party video games
sold in "packs". Some games are trivia based, some rely on players writing
answers to questions and prompts, some are just mini-puzzles and activities.

Each player uses a web-enabled device (phones are great, but you can just as
easily play from a browser window) to play along, answer questions, vote on
answers, and so on.

The main "game show" happens on **one** screen only - usually a separate
computer screen that all players in the same room can see.

This is where is can get slightly tricky with the remote players.

## Just playing, not hosting

You get the easiest steps in this gaming experience:

- make sure you have Discord installed
  - make sure you've been invited to the appropriate Discord server
  - make sure you've **joined** the server
  - join any channels as directed by the host
- visit [jackbox.tv](https://jackbox.tv) on your web-enabled device
  - when the session starts, enter the magic code (and your name) to join the game


## Screen sharing

Almost all video conferencing applications offer some form of screen-sharing,
allowing all participants to view the main presentation.

Very few of these offer audio sharing directly from the apps. It's possible to
have the host turn up their speaker volume and have it play over their
microphone, but this gets distorted and annoying quite quickly.

Some jackbox games aren't completely dependent on audio, and players can
respond to the on-screen questions.

Some games might benefit from one person taking on the role of "host presenter"
and reading out the on-screen text for everyone.

Some games are unplayable if you can't hear the audio.

## ... with audio

There are strange and crazy tools
